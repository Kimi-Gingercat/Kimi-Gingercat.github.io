The purpose of this website is to serve as a personal portfolio, showcasing my resume and a selection of my work. To create the site, I used HTML to structure the resume content, CSS to style the layout and make it visually appealing, and JavaScript to add basic interactivity of the website.
Users can navigate the site easily by clicking "Home" or "KZ" in the navigation bar, which will bring them back to the top of the page. Selecting "My Visualization" will direct users to a dedicated page featuring visualizations. When the mouse enters the hero section, an image of icons related to my hobits appears, and when the mouse leaves, the imag disappears. Clicking on the hero section triggers a pop-up greeting message. Additionally, clicking the email link from the contact section opens a new email window with my email address pre-filled. 
On the visualization page, a bar chart displays activities I completed last week, and there's a generative art piece made of randomly generated circles with varying colors, dimensions, and strokes. When hovering over a bar on the chart, the corresponding value is displayed for more precise data insight.
