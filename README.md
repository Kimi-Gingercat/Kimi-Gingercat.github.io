The purpose of this website is to serve as a personal portfolio, showcasing my resume and a selection of my work. To create the site, I used HTML to structure the resume content, CSS to style the layout and make it visually appealing, and JavaScript to add basic interactivity of the website.
Users can navigate the site easily by clicking "Home" or "KZ" on the navigation bar, which will bring them back to the top of the page. Selecting "My Visualization" will direct users to a dedicated page featuring visualizations. Additionally, clicking the email link opens a new email window with my email address pre-filled.
